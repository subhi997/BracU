/*
 * EXPLANATION
 * When a new thread is created, the thread is in the NEW state. When .start() method is called on a thread, the thread scheduler moves it to Runnable state. 
 * Whenever join() method is called on a thread instance, the current thread executing that statement will wait for this thread to move to Terminated state. 
 * So, before the final statement is printed on the console, the program calls join() on thread2 making the thread1 wait while thread2 completes its execution and is moved to Terminated state. 
 * thread1 goes to Waiting state because it it waiting for thread2 to complete it’s execution as it has called join on thread2.
