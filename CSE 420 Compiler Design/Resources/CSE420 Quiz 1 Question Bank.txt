Suppose you have the following line of code in Java.
int $a = "CSE420 is a fun and easy course";
In which compilation phase, will an error get detected?

(  ) Lexical Analysis
(  ) Syntax analysis
(x) Semantic Analysis
(  ) Both a and b
(  ) Both b and c

Which phase of the compiler identifies and generates tokens?

(x) Lexical Analyser
( ) Syntax Analyser
( ) Semantic Analyser
( ) Both a and b

Suppose you have the following line of code:
double 1m = 20.5; //Line 1
m = n + 2 +; //Line 2
You decide to use a compiler and then execute this program. Will the compiler detect any error before it stops execution? If yes, in which line(s), will the error be detected?

( ) No error 
( ) Line 1
( ) Line 2
(x)Both Line 1 and Line 2


Suppose you have the same lines of code:
double 1m = 20.5; //Line 1
m = n + 2 +; //Line 2
Now you decide to use an interpreter and then execute this same program. Will the interpreter detect any error before it stops execution? If yes, in which line(s), will the error be detected before stopping execution?

( ) No error 
(x) Line 1
( ) Line 2
( ) Both b and c

Which tool may be used to expand macros into source language statements?

( ) Linkers
( ) Loaders
( ) Assemblers
(x) Preprocessors

What is used to define the pattern in lexical analyser?

(x) Regular expression
( ) Context free grammar
( ) DFA
( ) NFA

Is DFA faster than NFA?

(x) True
( ) False

Redundancy is eliminated in which phase of the compiler?

( ) Intermediate code generator 
(x) Code optimizer
( ) Code generator
( ) Semantic Analyser

Intermediate code generator in the compiler produces machine dependent intermediate code.

( ) True
(x) False

What is the language generated by the regular expression a*(b|c)?

( )  {b, c, ab, ac, aab, aaabc......}
(x) {b, c, ab, ac, aab, aaab......}
( )  {ab, ac, aab, aaaac, aaabc, aaacb......}
( )  {b, c, ab, ac, bc, ba, aabb, aaabb......}

Which one of the following is used in the Lexical Analysis phase? (Select all that apply)
Parse tree
Regular Expressions

Lexical 
Syntax 
Semantic 
Runtime
Answer: b



Which one of the following languages over the alphabet {0,1} is described by the regular expression: (0+1)*0(0+1)*0(0+1)*?
The set of all strings containing the substring 00
The set of all strings containing at most two 0’s
The set of all strings containing at least two 0’s
a and c
Answer: c

How many transitions will a DFA over the alphabet {a, b} have if it has 3 states?
4
6
9
Depends on the Language it accepts
Answer: b

What benefit can we get from implementing a Regular Expression using DFA instead of NFA?
Less required space
Less required time
CLass of language that can be defined is expanded
b and c
Answer: b

Which phase of the compiler deals with the grammatical structure of a programming language? 
Lexical Analyser
Syntax Analyser
Semantic Analyser
All of the above
Answer: b

The set of all strings over ∑ = {0,1} that begins and ends with 0 is:
0(0+1)*0
01*0
00(0+1)0
All of these
Answer: a


Which of the following statement is true:

Assembly instructions don’t differ per computer architecture
Ans: c

The task of a preprocessor is
File Inclusion
Calling functions
Defining variables
Reduce number of lines in a code
Ans a


Which of the following is a syntax  error
Using double value in array index position
Starting a variable name with a digit
Missing semicolon at end of statement
Not using ‘else’ block for an ‘if’ statement
Ans c

Why does a lexical analyzer use buffer pairs to scan input?
